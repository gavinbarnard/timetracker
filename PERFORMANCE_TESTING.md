# Performance Testing Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive performance testing suite for the Time Tracker API backend. The suite generates realistic test data and measures API performance across different dataset sizes and query patterns.

## Overview

The performance testing suite includes:

- **Realistic data generation**: Creates 1, 2, and 4 years worth of time tracking tasks
- **Isolated test environment**: Uses dedicated Redis instance to avoid conflicts
- **Comprehensive metrics**: Tests full-year, monthly, and daily query performance
- **Automated reporting**: Generates detailed performance reports and comparisons

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate Test Data and Run All Tests

```bash
python3 run_performance_tests.py --generate-data --test-dataset all
```

### 2. Run Quick Validation Test

```bash
python3 run_performance_tests.py --quick-test
```

### 3. Test Specific Dataset

```bash
python3 run_performance_tests.py --test-dataset 1_year
```

## Test Data Characteristics

The generated test data mimics realistic time tracking usage:

### Data Distribution
- **1-12 tasks per day** with realistic duration (0.5-8 hours total per day)
- **Weighted weekday distribution**: 95% weekdays, 15% Saturdays, 5% Sundays
- **Realistic task descriptions**: Code reviews, meetings, debugging, etc.
- **Reference tickets**: Random ticket numbers with common prefixes

### Dataset Sizes
- **1 Year**: ~725 tasks (2024 data)
- **2 Years**: ~1,516 tasks (2023-2024 data)  
- **4 Years**: ~3,017 tasks (2021-2024 data)

## Performance Testing

### Test Environment
- **Isolated Redis**: Runs on port 6380 to avoid production conflicts
- **Dedicated Flask app**: Runs on port 5001 for testing
- **JSON data storage**: Uses Redis Stack with JSON capabilities
- **Search indexing**: Tests Redis search performance on timestamp fields

### Performance Metrics

#### Full Year Queries
- Retrieves all tasks for a complete year (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31)
- Measures average, median, min, max response times
- Calculates tasks per second throughput

#### Monthly Queries  
- Tests each month individually (January through December)
- Provides monthly performance breakdown
- Identifies seasonal performance variations

#### Daily Queries
- Samples 20 days throughout the year
- Tests single-day query performance
- Measures performance for varying daily task counts

### Expected Performance

Based on testing with Redis Stack:

| Dataset | Total Tasks | Year Query | Month Avg | Daily Avg | Tasks/Sec |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 Year  | 725         | ~22ms      | ~7ms      | ~5ms      | 31,400    |
| 2 Years | 1,516       | ~31ms      | ~7ms      | ~4ms      | 25,800    |  
| 4 Years | 3,017       | ~24ms      | ~6ms      | ~4ms      | 31,400    |

**Performance Rating**: ✅ Excellent (sub-100ms response times)

## Understanding Results

### Performance Report Sections

#### Full Year Performance
- **Average Duration**: Mean response time across iterations
- **Tasks Retrieved**: Total number of tasks returned
- **Tasks/Second**: Throughput metric (tasks ÷ average duration)

#### Monthly Performance Summary
- **Average Duration**: Mean monthly query performance
- **Min/Max Duration**: Performance range across months
- **Avg Tasks/Month**: Average monthly task count

#### Daily Performance Summary  
- **Average Duration**: Mean daily query performance
- **Avg Tasks/Day**: Average daily task count from samples

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Excellent**: < 100ms response times
- **Good**: 100-500ms response times  
- **Acceptable**: 500ms-1s response times
- **Needs Optimization**: > 1s response times

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Response Time Consistency**: Low standard deviation indicates stable performance
2. **Scalability**: Performance should scale reasonably with dataset size
3. **Query Pattern Performance**: Different query ranges (year/month/day) should perform appropriately
4. **Throughput**: Tasks per second indicates overall system capacity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Redis Connection Failed
```
Error: Failed to start Redis test container
```
**Solution**: Ensure Docker is running and port 6380 is available

#### Flask App Won't Start  
```
Error: Failed to start test Flask application
```
**Solution**: Check port 5001 is available and dependencies are installed

#### Search Index Issues
```
Warning: Redis search failed, falling back to in-memory filtering
```
**Solution**: This is usually harmless - the fallback provides the same results

#### Performance Much Slower Than Expected
- Check if other applications are using system resources
- Ensure Redis Stack (not basic Redis) is being used
- Verify SSD storage for better I/O performance

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging, run individual test scripts:

```bash
# Debug data loading
python3 debug_data_loading.py

# Check single dataset with verbose output
python3 test_single_dataset.py
```

## Production Considerations

### Redis Configuration
- **Memory**: Ensure adequate memory for dataset size
- **Persistence**: Configure RDB/AOF based on durability requirements  
- **Search Index**: Monitor index memory usage with large datasets
- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling for high-concurrency applications

### Performance Optimization
- **Index Strategy**: Consider additional indexes for common query patterns
- **Caching**: Implement application-level caching for frequently accessed data
- **Pagination**: Add pagination for large result sets in production
- **Monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring and alerting

### Scaling Recommendations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Consider Redis Cluster for very large datasets (>10M tasks)
- **Read Replicas**: Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- **Partitioning**: Partition data by date ranges for time-series workloads

## Contributing

To extend the performance testing suite:

1. **Add New Test Scenarios**: Extend `performance_test.py` with additional test methods
2. **Custom Data Patterns**: Modify `generate_test_data.py` for different data distributions  
3. **Additional Metrics**: Add new performance measurements in the reporting functions
4. **Integration Tests**: Create end-to-end workflow performance tests

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Redis Stack (Docker container)
- Flask and dependencies (from requirements.txt)
